What's coming up in containers

Cgroup Namespaces

@lazy1.png

* Virtualize /proc/self/cgroup
* Virtualize new cgroupfs mounts
* (example)

# cgm create freezer x1; x2
# cgm movepid freezer x1 $$;  other win x2;
# unshare 1, setns other
# cat /proc/self/cgroup, /proc/pid/cgroup

# lxc start x1; show /proc/self/cgroup

Namespaced file capabilities

* Allow containers to lay down file caps
* Without risking host being tricked

# capabilities are (MAC and hence) orthogonal to DAC, users
# often, setuid-root app drops some caps, sets keepcaps securebit, setuid
# file caps let you skip that - but only if you can count o nit
# cannot count on it when installing pkg in container

Tag security.nscapability with rootid:
* kuid of ns owner
* kuid of ns root
* either one?
* or just > 1 entries

Allowing container root to write xattr:
* New setfcap system call
* Allow setxattr if kuid matches writer
  * Support through libcap extension
  * Supports tar
  * But cannot detect own kuid if nested
* Kernel just fills in kuid

Mounts from user namespaces

VFS changes
• s_user_ns
• suid
• File capabilities
• Security modules
• Other miscellaneous changes

FUSE
• Already supports unprivileged mounts
   • But via a suid root helper ...
• User/group id translation
• Process id translation

FUSE: security
• About that suid root helper ...
• nosuid
• allow_other

ext4
• User/group id translation
• Limit privileged mount options
• Journal device access
• Backing store attacks

loopfs
• Psuedo filesystem
• Allows user namespaces to allocate
   loop devices
• Mount at /dev/loop
• Manage via /dev/loop/loop-control
• Kernel creates device nodes
• Prevent backing file modifications
